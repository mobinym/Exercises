#### Description:
`pytest` is a powerful Python testing framework that makes it easy to write simple tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries¹⁴. It's designed to be easy to use and requires less boilerplate code than other testing frameworks¹.

To get started with `pytest`, you first need to install it. This can be done using pip: `pip install -U pytest`². Once installed, you can check the installed version with `pytest --version`².

Writing tests in `pytest` is straightforward. You simply define functions that start with the word `test_`, and inside these functions, use `assert` statements to verify that your code is producing the expected output⁴. For example:

```python
def inc(x):
    return x + 1

def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

In this example, the `test_answer` function is a test that checks whether the `inc` function returns 5 when called with 3⁴.

To run your tests, you use the `pytest` command followed by the name of your test file: `pytest test_file.py`³. Pytest will automatically discover and run all the test functions in your file, and provide a summary of the test results at the end³.

One of the powerful features of `pytest` is its support for fixtures, which are functions that run before each test function to which they're applied. Fixtures are used to feed some data or context to the tests¹.

Another useful feature is marks, which can be used to categorize tests. For example, you can mark some tests as slow and then tell pytest to skip them¹.

Pytest also supports parametrization, which allows you to run a test with different sets of input data, and plugins for extending its functionality¹.

In conclusion, `pytest` is a versatile and powerful tool for testing Python code. Its simplicity, flexibility, and rich set of features make it an excellent choice for any Python project.
